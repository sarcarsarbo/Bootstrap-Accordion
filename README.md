- Live Site URL: [Deployed on Render](https://bootstrap-accordion.onrender.com/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For Card and Accordion
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I could discover the way in which a Bootstrap card/accordion is added to a site and customised to meet the style of the site.

### Continued development

This is a static component that can be used as a part of a larger website with more functionality.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Accordion](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/) - This helped me to implement an accordion in Bootstrap 5.
- [CSS @media Rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) - This helped me to use the CSS @media rule and implement different layouts for different screen sizes.
